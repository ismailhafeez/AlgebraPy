# AlgebraPy
Solve algebraic problems in a flash!

AlgebraPy is a personal project developed by me to solve algebraic problems in a single line!

For example:
```
import AlgebraPy as AP
solver = AP.Algebra()
print(solver.BasicSolution("x + 5 = 10")
-----------------------------------------
Output: 5
```
As this is a project still in development, it has many limitations.
> Only equations of one variable can be solved.
> 
> The variable *must* be the first value in the equations (Ex: x + 2 = 4)
> 
> Support for Exponents is yet to be added. As of now, basic addition/subtraction/multiplication/division is supported.

Updates will be added soon!
